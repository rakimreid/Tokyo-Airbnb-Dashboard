# Background 

COVID-19 upended the travel industry. Tokyo, Japan was one of the most impacted in terms of closed borders. One sector hit hard by the shutdown was Japan's travel industry. Since the late 2000s, Japan tourism boomed. That changed in March 2020 when borders closed. Japan remained closed to internationanl travelers longer than most countries. 

AirBnB usage flunctuated in part to swings in domestic travel and travel restrictions. 

InsideAirBnB collects data from AirBnB quarterly regarding a city's listings. We can use information to examine a snapshot of prices or trends. This project examines the former -- data from September 2022 AirBnB listings. 

InsideAirBnb describes itself as: 

"Inside Airbnb is a mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities.

We work towards a vision where data and information empower communities to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists."
